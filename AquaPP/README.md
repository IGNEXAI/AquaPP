## Development Environment Setup

To set up the development environment for AquaPP, follow these steps:

1.  **Install .NET SDK:**
    Ensure you have the .NET 9.0 SDK installed on your machine. You can download it from the official .NET website: [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)

2.  **Install Visual Studio (Windows) or Rider (Cross-platform):**
    *   **Visual Studio (Windows):** Download and install Visual Studio with the ".NET desktop development" workload.
    *   **JetBrains Rider (Cross-platform):** Download and install JetBrains Rider, which provides excellent support for .NET development on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

3.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AquaPP.git
    cd AquaPP
    ```

    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

5.  **Apply Database Migrations:**
    If the application uses a database, apply the migrations to set up the database schema. Ensure you are in the directory containing the `.csproj` file (e.g., `AquaPP/`):
    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Build the Project:**
    Navigate to the project root directory (where `AquaPP.sln` is located) and build the solution:
    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

2.  **Run the Application:**
    From the project root directory, you can run the application:
